If you say you're future of work, then you really need to live it out in your working culture. We believe in working however suits you best; not in measuring productivity by how often you come into the office. This is one of the reasons that our team has been built with a remote-first mindset. We have engineers sitting between EST to CET, across the east coasts of the Americas, Africa, and Europe. You could either join us in Copenhagen if you'd like or sit wherever you want if you fall between our timezones.

- ...and micro-services / distributed systems (Kubernetes, AWS Lambda, Kafka)
- DevOps culture and tools (CI/CD, Github Actions, Gradle, Terraform)

# Prezi

## Company blurb
Since 2009, we’ve been making virtual presentation tools that help people connect and collaborate more meaningfully with their audiences.
With the emergence of the hybrid workplace, we’ve focused our energy on Prezi Video, the first and only tool that lets anyone create professional-looking video presentations featuring their graphics on screen with them while they present in live video conferences or recorded, shareable videos.
Prezi Video works with popular video conferencing and collaboration tools such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Slack, and Cisco Webex, and has become an indispensable part of the modern hybrid workplace.

# Shareup

## Company blurb

Shareup is the easiest, fastest way to securely share anything with anyone. We help teams collect, organize, and make sense of the myriad of files, links, and services they use to get their work done everyday. Sharing is currently too difficult and stressful! We are obsessed with relieving that stress and anxiety.

We are a design-led company. We define design as “how it works.” This includes everyone having an overview of the tech fundamentals, understanding the full experience flow for the customer, and contributing to the beautiful details of everything we make—from UIs to code to icons to all the assets and interfaces our customers see and touch.

We are, at our core, a group of people passionate about building great products for our customers. We think those products require a strong design vision, solid engineering focused on performance and stability, and reacting to customer feedback. More than that, we believe every employee at Shareup has a part to play in making sure we always adhere to those principles.

## Remote status

Shareup is a remote-only company with flexible working hours and generous time off. We understand everyone’s life is different, and people should be allowed to work at the times that best suit them. Additionally, we think people do their best work when they are well-rested and rejuvenated. Every employee of Shareup receives 30 days of paid vacation per year, regardless of where they are based.

Given our commitment to remote work and flexible working hours, we think it’s important to cultivate a strong culture of writing. We believe this improves the quality of our ideas and work, ensures everyone has equal access to information, and gives newcomers the ability to understand the evolution of Shareup as a company and product. As an example of our culture of writing, we don’t have standup meetings. Instead, everyone writes down daily logs of the goals they have, the work they’ve done, the challenges they’ve experienced, and the solutions they discovered.

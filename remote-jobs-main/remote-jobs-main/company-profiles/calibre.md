# Calibre

## Company blurb

Calibre is an intentionally small, bootstrapped company building tools to help create faster, more equitable internet.

Our purpose is to serve and support people: our customers, teammates and the community. Being [people-first](https://calibreapp.com/blog/people-first-company) is fundamental to everything we do. This belief leads us to continually rethink traditional ways of doing business.

We choose to create a balanced and independent company: Calibre has been bootstrapped and profitable since its founding, and it steadily grows each year. In 2020, we have switched to [a four-day workweek](https://calibreapp.com/blog/four-day-work-week) to advance our commitment to sustainability and wellness. Now, weâ€™re a fully remote company too.

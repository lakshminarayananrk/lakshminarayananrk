# KickBack Rewards Systems

## Company blurb

KickBack Rewards Systems is a national leader in coalition loyalty marketing. We connect over 1200 retailers with their customers on an intimate level through rewards programs & loyalty solutions. Customers walk away with a deeper sense of brand loyalty, and our clients are rewarded with detailed customer buying habits to better learn how to serve their base. It happens millions of times each week—a customer shops at a convenience store, a drug store, supermarket, restaurant, or a host of other retail channels, and they hand over their loyalty card to earn valuable rewards points. It’s just a moment in time, but each interaction is unique, and it’s a connection that binds retailers and their most precious commodity: their customers. As a national leader in rewards programs and consumer engagement strategies, KRS develops business solutions that make retail operators smarter and more profitable while elevating the entire organization by anticipating the growing needs of their customers. With more than 20 years of experience, we’re recognized as the market leader in building rewarding customer experiences that generate brand loyalty, build repeat store visits, and increase bottom line sales.

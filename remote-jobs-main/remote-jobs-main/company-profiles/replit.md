# Replit

## Company blurb

We make programming more accessible by building powerful yet approachable tools and platforms for developers, students, and educators. We want to blur the line between learning and making– a place where you can hang out, tinker with ideas, learn new concepts, and launch a business all in the same day.

Replit is a platform for both newcomers and experts to express themselves. While computers are the most powerful tools to exist in the history of humanity, most people are just consumers of these machines. Our goal is to empower people as creators and give them computer superpowers– where every app, website, and program can be as personal as a home-cooked meal.

Creative empowerment is reflected in our team. We are transparent and open, value collaboration across different fields, and constantly talk to our users. Anyone and everyone (including interns!) can have an enormous impact and product-changing ideas. All you have to do is share.

We are at a unique point in time to be working on these problems and in a unique position to help solve them. Especially as global connectivity increases, browsers become more sophisticated, and schools begin to understand the need for coding literacy, Replit has a responsibility to help make the world of computing more equitable, powerful, and fun.

No matter how much we like computers, this all has to get done by people (us)! We celebrate all kinds of backgrounds, all of which inspire our conversations with computer science, education, psychology, design, business, art, literature, biology, and more. Help us expand that list!

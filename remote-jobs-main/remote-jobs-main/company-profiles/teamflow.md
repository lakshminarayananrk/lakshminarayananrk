# Teamflow

## Company blurb

[Teamflow](https://www.teamflowhq.com/?utm_source=remoteintech) is a virtual office for your team to hang out in. Bring back the presence of being in the office, the energy of working in the same room, the spontaneity of hallway conversations â€” the joy of feeling like a team.

## Company size

20-30

## Remote status

We are a fully remote company, with people working remotely from more than eight countries.

We also have open positions for non-engineering roles, all remote. :)

## Region

Anywhere in the world if you can work most of your working hours within UTC-8 and UTC+0

## Company technologies

The backend is written on Node.js using TypeScript. The frontend is a mix of PixiJS and React, all written in TypeScript. WebRTC is a fundamental part of the application, if you have experience with that it is a **huge** plus. The primary cloud provider we use is GCP. Almost everything is in a single monorepo.

## Office locations

We have our own office at https://www.teamflowhq.com/ where we hang out ;)

# Paytm Labs

## Company blurb

Founded in 2014 as a research and development division of Paytm, we now have offices in Toronto and Montreal (we’re currently all working remote until further notice because of the pandemic). Since we began, we’ve applied big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to Paytm’s data assets, providing optimal financial products to over 500 million consumers and over 20 million merchants.

## Company size

100-200

## Remote status

As mentioned above we have offices in Toronto and Montreal, but we are currently working remotely. When the offices open again we will still have the option to work remotely.

To keep things fun and stress-free during COVID-19 we started Virtual Daily, Virtual Weekly and Monthly team bonding activities including: Trivia, Games Nights, Movies Nights, Arts & Crafts (e.g. Origami), Lunch & Learns (e.g. Sign Language 101), Virtual Wellness Sessions (e.g. Meditation, Morning stretches), Virtual Team Ubereats Lunches, Wellness Packages and so much more!

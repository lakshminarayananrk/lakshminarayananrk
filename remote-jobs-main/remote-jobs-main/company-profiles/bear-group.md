## Company blurb

We’re a 26-person website development firm focused on building and supporting 
top-notch Magento, Drupal, and Shopify solutions that help businesses grow. We 
work with some amazing organizations across many industries, and are proud to 
play a part in their successes and—in many cases—their transformations.

## Company size

## Remote status

We’re a remote-first, US-based company with headquarters in Seattle. Being 
fully remote, we come together in Slack and Jira most often, with the occasional 
meeting in Zoom. We believe in creating the space—and freedom—for our team to 
focus, and really appreciate how we can do that remotely (with some lighthearted 
fun in the mix, of course!).

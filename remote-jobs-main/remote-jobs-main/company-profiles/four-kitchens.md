# Four Kitchens

## Company blurb

[Four Kitchens](https://fourkitchens.com/) builds websites and apps for organizations that depend on large-scale or unconventional content.

We help our clients figure out what they need, build and migrate to new systems, and maintain the systems you have. We can be their full-service team, or we can augment your existing team.

We work with clients like NBCUniversal, NYU, and PRI.

## Company size

40 and growing. We are Engineers, UX Strategists, Project Managers, Support Engineers, Designers, Account Managers, and more.

## Remote status

In 2016, Four Kitchens ditched their office of ten years and became a fully-distributed company.

We believe good talent is where you find it and, as a distributed team, we’re excited to be pioneers in what we believe is the future of work-culture. Even though we have no physical office, we strive to maintain a collaborative community using tools like Slack and Zoom. Our goal is for team members to feel like they are working together in the same room, even if they’re thousands of miles apart.

Here's few articles we've written on remote/distributed culture:

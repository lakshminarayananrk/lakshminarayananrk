## Company blurb

QuestDB is a high-performance open source database for time series. The project is built from scratch in Java and C++, with no dependencies, and is 100% free from garbage collection. The database is optimized for time series with high-throughput ingestion over InfluxDB Line Protocol and allows users to use SQL as a query language via PostgreSQL wire or REST API.

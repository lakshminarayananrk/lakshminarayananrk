# Tuft & Needle

## Company blurb

You won’t lose sleep on a Tuft & Needle mattress, and you won’t lose sleep when you work with us either.
T&N (tn.com) revolutionized the mattress space by turning the focus to the customer with always-honest pricing, an insistence on high-quality products, a world-class customer experience.
T&N quickly became the most disruptive and innovative company in the e-commerce bedding space.
Continuing to deliver on its mission in even bigger ways, we merged with Serta Simmons Bedding in September 2018, to expand the overall improvement to the industry.
As a result, more and more people are resting easier every day.

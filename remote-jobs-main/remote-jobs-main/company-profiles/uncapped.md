# Uncapped

## Company blurb

Founded in 2019, Uncapped is the fastest, most affordable way for growing online businesses to fund marketing and inventory. The company was born out of frustration with the limited financing options available for UK and European entrepreneurs to finance growth.

Uncapped provides business advances of between £10k and £5m without credit checks, personal guarantees, warrants, equity, or compounding interest and makes money by charging a low flat fee that is paid back from future sales revenue.

Uncapped has raised $120 million from investors including Lakestar, Mouro Capital, Global Founders Capital, White Star Capital, Seedcamp, and All Iron Ventures.

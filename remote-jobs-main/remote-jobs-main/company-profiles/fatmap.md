# FATMAP

## Company blurb

Adventures are all around us. At FATMAP we want to make them easier to discover, experience and share. The wild places of the world can often feel daunting yet within them lie many of life’s most rewarding experiences. We believe in a future where everyone can be an adventurer. From mountains to deserts, oceans to forests and beyond - at FATMAP we want to make these extraordinary places and their endless possibilities more accessible.

Whilst explorers of old needed extreme amounts of preparation or often simply strode blindly into the wilderness - at FATMAP we have brought together cutting-edge technologies and local experts to make adventures simpler and safer.

We’re building FATMAP as the Home for Outdoor Adventures.

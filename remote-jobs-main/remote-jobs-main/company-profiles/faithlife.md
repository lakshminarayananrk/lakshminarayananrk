## Remote status

Faithlife has been a remote-friendly company for years, and seamlessly transitioned to remote work during the Coronavirus pandemic. Most communication happens online via internal and external tools. 

Depending on the position and department, remote workers can be flown into the office on the company's expense several times a year to get face time with their teams. The company has an apartment in downtown Bellingham, which remote workers can use. 

The Faithlife People team also makes an effort to ensure that remote workers are included in in-person events such as product launches and our summer "Read for Cash" program where you're paid by the page to read business books.

## Company technologies

Professionally, our engineers gain experience working on large-platform projects and cutting-edge technologies in industries like Fintech, Healthcare, Cloud Providers and Blockchain, allowing them to quickly develop an attractive resume with a diverse skill set. Broadwing is the place for you if you despise "babysitting" production systems, if you feel like you're missing out on evolving technology, or if you want to take your experience to the next level.

Current technologies in use are focused on cloud computing and automation with IaC, CI/CD, and particularly with Kubernetes, where we do significant work developing cutting edge deployments in both cloud and edge environments. We often use Terraform, Nomad and other modern tools for cloud automation. In software engineering, we make use of full stack development with languages such as Python, Go, Rust and JavaScript, as well as databases such as PostgresQL or MySQL.

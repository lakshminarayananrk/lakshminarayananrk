# Quora

## Company blurb

The heart of Quora is questions — questions that affect the world, questions that explain recent world events, questions that guide important life decisions, and questions that provide insights into why other people think differently. Quora is a place where you can ask questions you care about and get answers that are amazing.

Quora’s mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. A vast amount of the knowledge that would be valuable to many people is currently only available to a few — either locked in people’s heads, or only accessible to select groups. We want to connect the people who have knowledge to the people who need it, to bring together people with different perspectives so they can understand each other better, and to empower everyone to share their knowledge for the benefit of the rest of the world.

## Company size

200-300 team members as of 2019

## Remote status

As of June 2020, Quora has become a "remote-first" company.

All of our positions can be performed remotely from anywhere in the world. (For any rare exceptions that do require work from a specific location, it will be noted explicitly in the individual position's job description)

However, because we are building a single, tightly-integrated product, we do value synchronous coordination and need for people to be able to talk to each other in real time. We have designated 9am to 3pm Pacific Time as "coordination hours", and most employees will be expected to be available for meetings and impromptu communication during this time, regardless of where they are located.

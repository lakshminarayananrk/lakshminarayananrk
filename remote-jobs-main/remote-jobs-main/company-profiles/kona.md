# Kona

## Company blurb

At Kona, we're making empathy mainstream at work, by integrating people-first leadership habits into the everyday workflow of every team.

Our first habit is daily emotional check-ins to fight burnout. We're working closely with 200+ beta teams at top companies like Vonage, GoodRx, MasterClass, Outreach.io, Canva, Greenhouse.io, and more. Weâ€™re seeing a 65% DAU/MAU ratio and 100% customer retention.

Teams that use Kona are happier, more connected, and report better team and personal mental health outcomes.

Our co-founders Andrew, Corine and Sid met at UCLA. Our early hires worked at Amazon, Microsoft, JPMorganChase and top remote work startups. We went through Techstars 2020, then raised a $1M pre-seed from Spencer Rascoff (founder/CEO, Zillow), Jeff Wilke (#2 exec at Amazon), The Fund, Overton VC, and more.

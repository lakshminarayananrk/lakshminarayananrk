# Aula Education

## Company blurb

Aula is a remote-first 50-person team from 20 nationalities building a communication platform for education. Think â€˜Slack for educationâ€™.

Powered by an ecosystem of integrations, Aula is the foundational layer in the university tech stack that shapes a whole industry.

We built Aula because we believe digital infrastructure should encourage community and participation-based learning.

Weâ€™re backed by people like the founder of Unity, CTO at Eventbrite, a co-founder of Zendesk, a co-founder of JustEat and world-class VCs like Project A, BrightEye and Sunstone.

## Company size

50-100.

## Remote status

Aula is a remote-first company. Remote workplaces can be full of trust, belonging, fun and safety - just like we are building community inWe believe remote work is a competitive advantage.

We are convinced that 'Aula as a remote company' would win against 'Aula as office-based company'.

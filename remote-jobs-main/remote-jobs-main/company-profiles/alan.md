## Company technologies

Our front-ends are in Typescript, React for web, React-Native for our mobile applications. We switched from Javascript a few months back. Our back-end is in Python/Flask. We use SQLAlchemy as our ORM. Our database is PostgreSQL. We also use Redis as a messaging system. We are deployed on AWS. All of our code is in two mono-repositories from which we deploy several applications, so no microservices here.

We have a CI/CD built with CirceCI. The CI runs the myriad of tests we have, both for backend and frontend. We donâ€™t have full integration tests, where we test both the front and back at the same time.

We like to be straightforward and simple. That doesnâ€™t mean we arenâ€™t opened to new solutions/technologies. When engineers want to introduce a new technology, they open a written discussion about it; itâ€™s like any decision making we do.

You can learn more about our technologies in our [product and technical blog](https://medium.com/alan).

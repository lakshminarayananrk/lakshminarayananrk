# Fireball Labs

## Company blurb

Fireball Labs GmbH was established in 2016 and is a profitable, self-funded, **100% remote** tech startup based in Germany. With our platform we buy and sell advertising space globally, collect and aggregate statistics and try to optimize and automate this process as much as possible. We aim to be a leading player in traffic monetization and are therefore looking for highly motivated new colleagues.

## Company size

We are a small team of 4 hoping to grow to 7-8 in the next months.

## Remote status

We are 100% remote. Jitsi, Matrix, Gitlab and email are the office. Apart from the occasional company gathering we do not plan to add any physical offices in the forseeable future.

## Region

Germany

All of the team is located in Germany and German is our company language. 

## Company technologies

Our platform runs on Linux and we are preparing to move into a cloud environment. Frontends are built using Typescript, React and jQuery. MySQL and Clickhouse are our databases and Redis is used for caching. The backend is implemented in Go/GoLang. Gitlab and Gitlab runner are used for CI/CD.

## Office locations

There is a physical office in Bad Wiessee near beautiful Lake Tegernsee. Most of us have never been there though :)
